This book contains the transcripts of three audio tapes containing an interview with Gerald Wiggins conducted by Steven Isoardi, a jazz musician and journalist. Wiggins was born in New York City in 1922 and later moved to Los Angeles. The interview tracks the early life of Wiggins and his career developments while offering a unique perspective into the life of a musician who played in Los Angeles from the 1940s to the 1960s.

Wiggins began playing the piano when he was four at the insistence of his mother. He began  in the classical style but later switched to jazz because “[he] couldn’t make a living in New York playing classical music.”  In the 1940’s, he moved to Los Angeles and worked with many artists doing numerous gigs, including playing at local jazz bars, vocal coaching, composing background music, and touring with other artists. Wiggins details the LA music scene, as well as Central Avenue - a street in Los Angeles known for its importance to the jazz scene - and the venues associated with it. Wiggins offers unprecedented insight into “the biz” of the jazz community, as well as the LA jazz scene and culture of the time.

The first tape gives a brief description of the life of Gerald Wiggins. Born in New York City, Wiggins started music at a young age, taking piano lessons at four years old, and practicing with his piano teachers until he got to high school. He attended a school for music and arts, and though his preference was piano, he chose to play bass violin because of an excess of pianists at his school. His mother had him on a tight schedule when it came to music. He practiced four to five hours a day between eating and school, but looking back, he always thought he should have practiced so much more. “Now I wish I had worked harder at it, but you never know where you’re going…Actually, I wish I’d have done eight hours a day, because that’s what it takes to really become a good musician.”

Wiggins’ rigorous passion for music started as a favor for his mother, but it quickly turned into a love that he pursued as a career. Realizing that classical music—or “robot music” as he called it—was too bland for him, he began to explore his interest in jazz music. His drive came from knowing that “if you played the parties, the girls would flock around you.” As he developed this love of music, Wiggins started listening to different bands to find out “what they were doing” and “what [their music] was all about”. He looked up to many musicians such as Johnny Hodges, Chick Webb, the Lunceford band, and Basie and emulated their styles.

The Apollo Theater in New York played a huge part in the development of Wiggins’s music. “You know, you could go to the Apollo every week and hear a different band, which was great. Some you liked, and some you didn’t like. But the Apollo was really where I really got a musical education, because they had the best of bands there.” He was lucky to have opportunities to play professionally as early as his high school years. After being given a chance to go to California by a house band leader, Les Hite, whose band member got drafted, Wiggins was given opportunities to work with big businesses, composing background music for Marilyn Monroe movies, playing at famous venues like Central Avenue, and discovering the difference between East Coast and West Coast jazz.

On the second tape, Gerald Wiggins focuses on the LA music scene, as well as the local clubs and what life as an artist was like. He recalls his early days playing the piano and how he didn’t take much of an interest until he realized girls liked it when he played piano. Wiggins was in a unique position to compare New York and Los Angeles because he was a full-fledged professional in New York before he moved to Los Angeles. He provides a possible explanation for everything (music-wise) happening in New York before LA as the fact that LA is so scattered. There were far fewer clubs in Los Angeles compared to New York and you had to drive to get to each one. At one point Wiggins stated that it was hard to see more than one group a night, which had much to do with LA - specifically Central Avenue -  being so spread out. In addition, Wiggins contrasts the unions in the two cities. In New York he was not a member of any music union but in LA he was a member of the American Federation of Musicians, Local 767 before he witnessed its amalgamation with the white union. Wiggins worked various film related jobs during his career, including appearing as band members and working on background music.

In the third tape, Gerald Wiggins discusses the various musicians that he befriended on Central Avenue. Remembering this portion of his life from many years ago, Wiggins’s memory was fuzzy and incomplete. He was able to remember some names that the interviewer recognized, such as Frank Mapps (baritone player), Hawk Nelson (tenor saxophone player), and Art Tatum (well-known pianist). Isoardi was very interested in the various jazz club owners that Wiggins dealt with, but Wiggins had almost no memory of these men. Wiggins explained that most jazz musicians did not care who the owner of the club was as long as they get paid at the end of the night. Wiggins talked about his experience with the Local American Federation of Musicians Union 767. He mentions some significant people within the union but did not expand on them other than just giving their position. As rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) began to gain popularity in Central Avenue, Wiggins recalled his extreme dislike for the style of music. He called it “junk” and says he would just wait for the fad to pass. Finally, unsatisfied with his own memory of the events of Central Avenue in the mid-1900s, Gerald Wiggins suggests various others artists, producers, and club owners that Isoardi should speak with.

On the second side of the tape, Wiggins discussed the fall of Central Avenue as well as the significance that it had on the jazz community. He claims that the reason Central Avenue declined in popularity was simply that it was becoming more acceptable for African-Americans at the time to occupy other cities. At first, they were limited to Central Avenue, but once they had a greater amount of choices of city, many blacks began moving further west and thus spread out more. Wiggins cites two reasons why Central Avenue was significant to the jazz community at the time. The first is that it is close to Hollywood, and therefore famous movie stars would often make appearances. The second is that, unlike many jazz towns at the time, it was socially acceptable for any Central Avenue musician to pick up their instrument and join a performing group onstage. This was unheard of in other jazz-centers such as Fifty-Second Street. Wiggins then goes on to talk about his four years of music lessons with Lyle “Spud” Murphy. Wiggins is very fond of his revolutionary method for arranging called the Equal Interval System. How this system works is not explained in the tapes.

Together, these tapes paint a picture of historic Central Avenue jazz scene in Los Angeles. This transcript is a valuable resource, giving insight into the life of a musician who truly represents the spirit of Los Angeles in the middle of the twentieth century. More than just a piece of history, this interview is intimate and provides insight into the life of many jazz musicians throughout the city. Wiggins and his contemporaries made LA jazz into what it is today as a distinctive and unique style of music.
