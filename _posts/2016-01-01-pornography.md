The Feminist Perspective on Pornography Conference took place in the year 1978. At the time, pornograhy was skyrocketing. Pornography has always existed, but gained momentum as a business in the 1960s, right in the heart of the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County. In particular, since the 1976 release of the controversial hardcore film Snuff, women created organizations and conferences to end violence in pornography.

Pornography producers sought to maximize their profits by making the movies a mainstream form of entertainment. Although many viewers see pornography as harmless, the industry’s dehumanizing of actors resembles human trafficking. For example, in addition to Snuff, other notorious hardcore films were made, and customers couldn’t get enough. This proliferation of pornography and violence led to the conference whose program you see depicted here.

The conference was held in San Francisco, California and had a great influence on the feminist anti-pornography movement in the late 1970’s. Some of its founding members were Laura Lederer, Lynn Campbell, Diana Russell, Kathleen Barry, and Susan Griffin. They joined forces to change the industry. The Los Angeles members of Women Against Violence Against Women, founded in 1976 by Marcia Womongold, attended the conference. The film Snuff pushed these women to protest, write letters, and make phone calls to stop it from screening.

The pornography industry is still prevalent in Los Angeles today, but conferences like Feminist Perspective on Pornograph helped to stop the violence and dehumanization of women. 
Last year on Valentine’s Day, the BDSM (Bondage, Dominance, Sadism and Masochism) ‘romance’ film Fifty Shades of Grey “was an immediate box office success, breaking numerous box office records and earning over $566 million worldwide” (“Fifty”). Natalie Collins began a campaign, “50 Shades is Domestic Abuse”, to stop this film from screening. This campaign consists of hashtags and social media to bring attention and awareness to the brutality women face in media. Women today continue to fight to end the injustices in the pornography industry through different mediums, like the conference depicted below.
