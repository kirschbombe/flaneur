This hand crafted cookbook is composed of scripted hispanic recipes accented with watercolor depictions.  Stretching diagonally across the front cover of the cookbook is a beautifully intricate watercolor painting of a traditional Ranchero house. The illustration focuses on a wooden house, dusty white in color accented with a peeling green trim, which supports a small red brick chimney.  Surrounding the house on either side is a darker green plant landscape bisected by a brown walk path on the right side of the house. The San Gabriel mountains rising in the background are washed gray, softly meeting the faintly blue sky.  Inscripted in the northwest corner is a tri-pronged figure, signifying the Brand of Ranchero.  Below this lies the title of the cookbook, Recuerdos de los Rancheros, also written at the same angle as the watercolor depiction below. In the southeast corner of the cover lies a brief description of the painting, as well as the copyright date and signature of the author, Mary E. Johnston.  After opening the main cover, the reader is indulged with authentic hispanic recipes for dishes such as enchiladas, chile con carne and tamales, each accompanied by small paintings of the prepared dishes. But the food described in this book has deeper importance than simple family recipes.

A combination of Native American and Spanish influences, food is a symbolization for the Mexican identity. In history, such significance determined societal status in the colonial period from the Native American “people of corn” and European wheat-eating aristocrats. Corn tortillas and wheat bread thus represented the numerous divisions between the traditional countryside and the progressive cities. Many different culinary practices such as Native American, creole Hispanic, and modern French, influenced the creation of a mestizo cuisine particularly by women and the lower classes that represent the national identity. Many Mexicans eat tortillas on a daily basis as a main staple and during celebrations. The corn dough is then used to make corn husk wrapped cakes called tamales. Tamales began the start of Mexican culinary art as people created finely detailed dishes by twisting and folding the maize dough into exquisite forms while incorporating rich flavors of herbs and chiles (Pilcher 1996). While food is clearly important to the Mexican culture, what about the place on the front cover?

In 1840, Governor Juan B. Alvarado granted a piece of land called Rancho San Pascual to Jose Perez and Enrique Sepulveda. Perez and Sepulveda each constructed their own small houses on the land. In 1841, Perez died and by 1843, Sepulveda had moved away from the rancho. Rancho San Pascual was abandoned. An officer in the Mexican Army named Manuel Garfias asked to have the land. In November 1843, he was given the grant from Governor Manuel Micheltorena. Manuel Garfias paid $100 to the widow of Perez and $70 to Sepulveda in exchange for the small houses. He then lived on Rancho San Pascual. During the Battle of La Mesa in January 1847, Mexican troops were defeated by the Americans and withdrew to Rancho San Pascual. After, the United States soon gained control of California. All land claims had to be presented to the U.S. Land Commission for review when California became a state. The three members of the Land Commission arrived in Los Angeles in 1852 and Manuel Garfias greeted them warmly. He wanted them to confirm his ownership of Rancho San Pascual, so he hosted a grand ball to honor their presence in his Los Angeles home. The land claim was later approved. Afterwards, Manuel Garfias went on to build the San Pascual Rancho house, the house that the cover watercolor art of Recuerdos de los Rancheros was based on. As neighborhoods were constructed, irrigation systems were erected, reservoirs were established, and orchards were planted, Rancho San Pascual became the city of Pasadena in 1874 (California Rancheros).  The ranchero house would stand erect for another 20 years before inspiring the watercolor artist.

Mary E. Johnston, the artist and author of Recuerdos de Los Rancheros, seems to be forgotten in history. While there is hardly any information about her, the information acquired is significant. Johnston was a student at State Normal School of Los Angeles and belonged to the senior class of 1892 which consisted of 78 students (State Normal School Groups). As a matter of fact, she was one of the four female graduates of that class from Pasadena (History of Pasadena). Adding to this, State Normal School of Los Angeles was established in 1882 and served as a former name of UCLA until 1919. Technically, the author of this authentic cookbook was a graduate from UCLA campus before it became a University of California.
