desc: "This picture is of the San Francisquito Power Plant #1. Nature, through great storms such like this, caused much pain during the building of the aqueduct. The location of the buildings were the main factor in them being practically dismantled by the storms. As the storms shower the mountain, great streams of water streams down, and, because the buildings have to be geographically near the river in order to either create power or house and feed workers, they are hit with a massive tidal wave and demolished. The engineers learned this and Mulholland was able to create a more sturdy, temporary building that wouldn't wash away quite as easily. The storms themselves were then on only able to damage buildings that were being built. Storms such as these did not impact the construction for very long as most of the materials were salvageable and with the massive work force, new buildings sprang up quickly after the storm drained away. Water raining down in huge amounts also affected the latter end of construction of the aqueduct. The huge inverted siphons that were installed in the valleys the river had to go through were liable to rust in small quantities as well as winter freezing that could split open the smallest cracks as well as atmospheric pressure and fast floods. This happened three months after the completion of the aqueduct where a flash flood and atmospheric pressure caused a siphon to collapse, with an estimated repair cost of around two-hundred fifty thousand dollars. The siphons themselves were steel, sometimes weighing hundreds of tons, and the geology of the area made it extremely difficult to bring the siphons in and weld them together along with putting pylons in with the accuracy and precision the engineers needed."

This picture is of the San Francisquito Power Plant #1. Nature, through great storms such like this, caused much pain during the building of the aqueduct. The location of the buildings were the main factor in them being practically dismantled by the storms.

Water raining down in huge amounts also affected the latter end of construction of the aqueduct. The huge inverted siphons that were installed in the valleys the river had to go through were liable to rust in small quantities as well as winter freezing that could split open the smallest cracks as well as atmospheric pressure and fast floods. This happened three months after the completion of the aqueduct where a flash flood and atmospheric pressure caused a siphon to collapse, with an estimated repair cost of around two-hundred fifty thousand dollars. The siphons themselves were steel, sometimes weighing hundreds of tons, and the geology of the area made it extremely difficult to bring the siphons in and weld them together along with putting pylons in with the accuracy and precision the engineers needed.

The desert and its environment created its own set of problems for the creation of the aqueduct. Endless wind, sand blowing, and lack of water were only some problems plaguing the construction. Food and its availability and freshness also suffered. As the aqueduct grew longer and longer, the food chain required to feed the workers became more and more strained, taxing the available resources. Eventually, the arid climate and heat caused meat to start rotting in the carts used to transport it and maggots started growing in most of the produce. This slowed down work and, eventually, caused massive strikes that caused work to slow to a standstill, with only skeleton crews in the most necessary tunnels such as the record-breaking Elizabeth Tunnel. Though workers later came back, the damage cost by the climate and environment numbered in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The eternal winds of the desert blew sand into everything; tractor engines, mens' mouths and eyes, and into the food the men ate. Extra expenses for bandanas, dust shields, and sides for tents caused stress among the bond buyers and could have contributed to their refusal to buy more bonds as the stock market collapsed midway through construction. The desert also caused long tunnels running below ground so the water wouldn't evaporate away and dwindle to nothing when it finally got to Los Angeles. This created even more problems in how to make these tunnels, how big they should be, and the cost of the materials and manpower to build them, while still sometimes in the dead of summer with temperatures approaching one hundred thirty degrees Fahrenheit.

The scrapbook demonstrates the completion of the aqueduct to the public and illustrates how their tax dollars created a better system for them. Creating a more stable city, the aqueduct allowed more people to immigrate to the city therefore increasing the work force and the city’s prestige. The aqueduct project would cost twenty-six million dollars million with land purchases and construction so the city needed to show the public that having a better water supply would result in the growth of Los Angeles.

Though the picture itself is important, its implications and effect it would have on the common person exceeds that. The style of propaganda implemented focuses on the everyday common person and their benefits from the aqueduct. Describing the battle between man and nature, the pictures convey the lessening of fear of the common person about where they would get their water from next. With water able to be transported from other places, irrigation systems would improve, agriculture and farms in Southern California would flourish. Storms proved quite formidable as shown in the image, all the pipes scattered, roof sheds blown off, pieces of lumber everywhere, trees destroyed and the mud terrain made it extremely difficult to get work going again. Despite the storm delaying the construction, the hard workers kept on working to finish, and eventually best nature. The citizens and residents soon had a completed aqueduct with which they could enjoy an abundant supply of water. The scrapbook illustrates the everyday nature of ordinary man; building, destroying, and rebuilding once again, and their slow working towards a common goal. The journey from the beginning of the aqueduct to its completion would be bounded together and told through the photos. The various locations, regions, and terrain where the construction took part in were all conquered and crucial parts of the Aqueduct. The sense that nature, while terrifying and destructive, can also be tamed and used for the benefits of the everyday person personifies this scrapbook.
