In 1954, the Supreme Court ruling of Brown v Board of Education required schools to integrate colored students into white schools. Although the ruling included Chicanx students, the Los Angeles Unified School District failed to accommodate them, keeping them separate from white students in terms of quality of education and treatment by school staff. Many East Los Angeles public schools prohibited Chicanx students from speaking Spanish or taking AP or honors courses. Instead, they took industrial arts and secretarial courses, severely limiting their opportunities for higher education. This discrimination combined with the racism and classism of the general public motivated Chicanx students to stand up to the school district. On March 1, 1968, Wilson High School students “prematurely” walked out of school in protest (Soldatenko 291). Many refused to comply with police, who tried to repress the walkout by violently arresting and injuring participants (Soldatenko 291). In the next week, students walked out of high schools all over East Los Angeles shouting “Blow Outs,” and the strike later spread to junior high and African American students (Soldatenko 291). These protests constituted the East Los Angeles Blowouts, which sparked a movement for educational reform and provided a leap in political participation of Chicanx people (Soldatenko 291).
On March 17, 1968, the Los Angeles Times published an article by Dial Torgerson entitled ‘Brown Power’ Unity Seen Behind School Disorders, a front page report on the Chicano Blowouts. Torgerson interviewed students, leaders of the movement, and other key figures to explain the events leading up to the blowouts and their significance to both Mexican-Americans and the people of Los Angeles. Images of students, police officers, leaders of the movement, and others scattered throughout the three-page article provided readers an impassioned but realistic view of the movement.
Torgerson identified Sal Castro, a Chicano teacher at Lincoln High School and an influential leader of the Blowouts. Castro resented the lack of government support from Chicanx students, noticing that many remained in poverty despite receiving the same education as white students. Schools placed students in classes “based on what [they] considered ‘a realistic assessment of the chances of success,’” deterring minority students from pursuing higher education by enrolling them in mostly industrial arts and secretarial classes. (Torgerson 2). When frustrated Chicanx students approached Castro for help, he proposed that they provide the Board of Education with a set of changes for improving schools. The walkouts served as a backup plan if the Board did not implement the presented changes. After the principal at Wilson High School cancelled a play, their students spontaneously “blew out” in protest (Torgerson 2). Other schools followedㅡ―Garfield, Roosevelt, Lincoln, and Wilson High- as well as other Chicanx high schools, junior-high schools, and predominately African-American schools.
The Brown Berets, a militant Mexican-American group, were known for their protective contributions to the Blowouts. This “gang” of Mexican-American kids served as a less violent option for kids who may have joined traditional gangs (Torgerson 3). Because police intimidated, arrested, and injured students, the Brown Berets “put [themselves] between the police and the kids, and took the beating” in order to protect the students who peacefully walked out (Torgerson 2). Although many people suffered during the protests, the collaborative efforts of teachers, students, and members of the community led to the walkouts’ success.
Torgerson explained the uprising through the long history of Chicanx repression: “since World War II the Mexican-American community has [called] for unity, change, better education, civil rights, economic opportunity, and an end to...second class citizenship.” They were ignored until the walkouts. Torgerson interviewed Philip Montez, the western program director for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Montez argued that older generations could not successfully bring about change, because “with livings to make, kids to raise...we could never get a commitment” (Torgerson 2). Montez attributed the younger generation’s success to their assimilation in American society. While older Mexican-American generations held faith in democracy, conservative family values, and the belief that “through good graces you’d achieve success,” the newer generation of Chicanx, curious and proud of their Mexican culture, quickly took action and found their own solutions to many social problems (Torgerson 2).
Torgerson’s front-page article, published 16 days after the initial walkout, brought Mexican-American problems to the public’s attention. Although many issues of Los Angeles public education are still in discussion today, the blowouts marked a significant progression of Mexican-American political participation. The blowouts immediately sparked picketing, marches, sit-ins, political debates, and other forms of political participation as the movement spread from students to their families, friends, and the larger community (Soldatenko 292). Slowly, over time, educational experiences for many Chicanx, other minority, and low-income students improved. Educational reform programs such as Bright Prospects, Upward Bound, and AVID were founded with the sole purpose of helping minority students attend college. Most importantly, the blowouts gave young Chicanx students a voice, which they used to create a movement for themselves, other minorities, and future generations.
