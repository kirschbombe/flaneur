Jean Renoir is a name that may not sound familiar to our generation, but during the early 1900’s, he served as a very prominent figure in cinema. Renoir was a Frenchmen, born in the Montmartre section of Paris. Renoir complemented his early love for art by writing poetry, and proceeded to earn a degree from the University of Aix-en-Province in 1913. He joined the nation's cavalry for World War I, but was quickly put out of commission because of a bullet injury to his leg.

Renoir’s initial interest in film began while he spent his recovery time watching movies: Charlie Chaplin’s sparked his decision to start a career in film, and his early inspiration for his first films came from the decease of his wife, Catherine. He started his career with avant-garde uses of dream sequences and and satirized the French bourgeoisie through renditions of their everyday lives.

Renoir’s early films didn't receive any commercial success, but as film culture in France evolved, his directing approach followed suit. La Grande Illusion, a story of French prisoners of war trying to escape during World War I is both his most notable and most controversial film in France, known for highlighting the provocative themes of patriotism and brotherhood. La Grande Illusion is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of French cinema and among the greatest films ever made, winning recognition as the Best Foreign Film at the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards and the first foreign language film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

The film is set at a war camp where soldiers from different countries share common experiences, more specifically contrasting the relationships of upper and lower classes.

 Two aristocrat characters, de Boeldieu and von Rauffenstein, are portrayed as cosmopolitan men, educated in many fields and able to speak several languages. Their similar level of education allow them to relate to each other much easier than other classes. Renoir contrasts them with other lower-class characters, although  they do find common ground in their unhappiness with the French class system.

Jean Renoir’s involvement as a French cavalry officer inspired his interest in the class structure of France, and his particular compassion towards the working class. His earlier years were spent developing his passion for nature and film, though the horrors of World War I immersed him in political strife and atrocity. Because of his unique artistic development, Renoir’s early film career challenged French social structure, thus alienating him from his status quo. Renoir is notorious for challenging public opinion with his satirical films, specifically La Règle du Jeu (The Rules of the Game) and La Grande Illusion. La Grande Illusion’s general ideological line is quite straightforward, calling for the unity of all Frenchmen across class barriers, and depicts, approvingly, voluntary sacrifices by the aristocratic spirit on behalf of a more democratic France. His affirmations of community climaxes with the help of a compound element: language. All nationalities speak their own language among themselves, yet spoken French is what they share as a common identity.

Renoir’s political ideology gathers insight from topics of injustice, inequality, and domination of power vested in the few. Along with language, he courageously included anti fascist messages in his films. He optimistically approaches wartime as a temporary division.

Renoir eventually migrated to Hollywood to escape the invasion of France during World War II. The entire film industry of America symbolized a dynamic yet everlasting medium and a chance to explore low to high culture film making. Renoir struggled with finding subjects of interest to film in America, and his introductory work produced in Hollywood met with little success. His travels in India in 1949 sparked inspiration, leading to the production of his first full-color film, The River. Renoir’s film brought recognition to the beautiful colors, bazaars, and impoverished colonial life present throughout India, the exact “realness” he strived to portray ever since the start of his career in cinema.

He returned to Paris with a new inspiration for film as an art form. As his health declined, he did not have the vigor to produce anymore and moved back to his house in Beverly Hills. Renoir passed away in 1979, and his body was sent back to France to be buried next to his family in the cemetery in Essoyes, Aube. Throughout his career, Renoir utilized a variety of lighting, backdrop settings, camera angles, and other notable technical and visual representations. He experimented with various forms of cinema techniques, creating silent films, technicolor masterpieces, and even attempting cinemascope. Renior revolutionized the film making industry, and his honors continued after his death. He is now honored as one of the best directors to this day, gracing the streets of modern Los Angeles with his own star on the Hollywood walk of fame.
