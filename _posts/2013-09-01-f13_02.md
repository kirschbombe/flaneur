desc: "In 1959 in a hilly alcove known as Chavez Ravine, the construction of today’s Los Angeles landmark, Dodger Stadium, began. That same year, a little girl and resident of the ravine, was photographed standing on her family’s property. Features contorted, she holds a sign of protest that reads, “Can you buy three lots and two houses for $10,000”, which directly addresses the city of Los Angeles. Compositionally, the image not only documents a time and place, but also functions as an artistic statement: captured directly in the center of the Polaroid frame, the little girl becomes both a literal central figure, and a figurative heroine in the battle for her community lost to corporate modernization."

In 1959 in a hilly alcove known as Chavez Ravine, the construction of today’s Los Angeles landmark, Dodger Stadium, began. That same year, a little girl and resident of the ravine, was photographed standing on her family’s property. Features contorted, she holds a sign of protest that reads, “Can you buy three lots and two houses for $10,000”, which directly addresses the city of Los Angeles. Compositionally, the image not only documents a time and place, but also functions as an artistic statement: captured directly in the center of the Polaroid frame, the little girl becomes both a literal central figure, and a figurative heroine in the battle for her community lost to corporate modernization.

turn of the century into the late early 1950s, this little girl and nearly 300 families, now largely third generation Mexican American, lived here peacefully in the three neighborhoods of Palo Verde, Bishop, and La Loma . In this pastoral enclave, they ran their own elementary school and Roman Catholic churches, raised livestock, operated horse-drawn plows and planted hillsides with sugar cane and corn (Masters). And while the ravine was known to suffer from poverty, most outsiders commented on the pride in homeownership and deep sense of community that seemed to overcome its flaws. The place was quite like the Mexican villages these people had left behind, and the community was a charming and vital specimen of an old Los Angeles, but its years were numbered (Parson, 167).

ay from the little barrio, downtown Los Angeles began to rise like wildfire. It was the end of World War II, and the population rose from returning veterans, and others who were quickly feeding into Los Angeles (McCue, 47). Urban liberals came to the forefront of local politics, seeking “cornerstone for a humane and democratic citywide redevelopment” through public housing programs (Parson, 350). In 1950, under the 1949 American Housing Act, the Los Angeles City Housing Authority (CHA) signed a contract with the City of Los Angeles, which targeted Chavez Ravine as a one of the eleven &quot;logical selections of redevelopment areas&quot; for decent affordable public housing (Hines, 143). So close to the heart of the city, Chavez Ravine became the crowned jewel of the plan and thus the focus of many city officials, liberal and conservative alike.

Wilkinson, co-director and advocate of the CHA, and Mayor Bowron believed the project would benefit the community, and promised the residents that they would be offered first pick in the new housing (Hines, 138). Families of the Chavez Ravine who believed that the project was well intentioned vacated the area for construction. In 1953, however, during the era of McCarthyism, Congressman Norris Poulson defeated Mayor Bowron in the election for city mayor by running on an anti-housing platform in which he argued that the public housing project was socialistic (Hines, 140). As mayor, Poulson struck down the plan for redevelopment in Chavez Ravine. In a series of compromises, the Housing Authority agreed to resell its land holdings to the city under the provision that the land be used for public projects (Hines, 140); however, city officials with Mayor Poulson in the lead, saw the mostly vacant Chavez Ravine as an opportunity for larger corporate franchise.

negotiating with Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley, Mayor Poulson and city officials agreed to make Chavez Ravine the team’s new home. And although the Dodger deal clearly violated the Housing Authority’s condition to keep the land public, the court claimed that this simply no longer applied since the city no longer owned the land (Hines, 141). Consequently, families who still refused to give up their homes for such meager compensation were forcibly evicted by court order. Photographs of policemen dragging residents out of their homes by their legs and feet would grace the television screens and newspapers across the nation. Councilman Karl Rundberg later explained to the Los Angeles Times: “the way their private property was confiscated through the guise of public use only to be turned over to Private Corporation is a miscarriage of justice. It is also a flagrant violation of the Constitution of the United States” (Parson, 148).

 the Polaroid stands for her right to her family’s property. She embodies the spirit of Chavez Ravine, innocent and vulnerable while the sign she holds challenges the corruptness of the city of Los Angeles. Today, where this little girl once stood, one might identify a bleacher, or a dugout, or home plate; one would at least be standing somewhere within the great monument of Dodger Stadium. Many still feel that the Dodgers kicked out the residents of the ravine singlehandedly, but it was not so simple; inevitable modernization ultimately brought the fate of the small Mexican American community.

Out of all of this, it is important to remember that although the residents lost the battle for Chavez Ravine, their fortitude and protest inspires new generations of citizens faced with similar circumstances, and provides a context in which the tyranny of the political minority can be met by a once culturally ignored people armed with historical precedent. If the concept of a curse were to exist, culturally Los Angeles felt that it was cursed, or at least that it had done wrong. From this innate feeling we continue to progress geographically and also morally as a city.
