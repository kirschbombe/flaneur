Between the Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains lies the semiarid Owen’s Valley, the lowest valley in America. Owen’s Lake, which sits at the southern end of the valley, was and continues to be an infamous scene in the California Water Wars. The building of the Los Angeles Aqueduct posed controversy before, during, and many years after its completion. The Aqueduct significantly and oppositely affected both Owen’s Valley and the City of Los Angeles politically, economically, and environmentally.

Once the Los Angeles River ceased to be a water source, the people of Los Angeles looked elsewhere for a replacement. William Mulholland, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Water Department in the early 1900s, believed that the best course of action was to build an Aqueduct that would bring water from Owens Valley to Los Angeles (Cooper 1968). Plans for building the Aqueduct were well underway even before the news was made public. Surveys and purchase of land for Aqueduct building purposes quietly went on; no one in Owens Valley or Los Angeles noticed anything (Cooper 1968).

When the plan was made public in 1905, there were mixed reactions among the people of Owens Valley and Los Angeles. Los Angeles residents were overjoyed with their supplemental water source, but Owens Valley residents felt upset at what they thought was the theft of their water (Cooper 1968). The main opponents of the Aqueduct mostly consisted of Owens Valley residents, although a few land speculators and private power interests also joined in on the opposition. Although they tried their best to prevent the Aqueduct’s construction, their plans were ultimately thwarted when President Theodore Roosevelt sided with Los Angeles and federally approved the project (Kahrl 1976). The construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct began in 1908 and took five years to complete (Walton 1992). Once the Aqueduct was finished, even more people emigrated to Los Angeles, since the Aqueduct allowed the city to support more people (Cooper 1968).

The construction of the Owens Valley Aqueduct had a significant impact on Los Angeles and surrounding cities. Even with the population of Los Angeles already rapidly growing, the city experienced a boom. The seemingly abundant supply of water drew more people to southern California. Additionally, “water-consuming industries sought out Los Angeles in preference to other communities” (Cooper 64) which added to the area’s production capabilities. These growths were not without their drawback. To maximize the water that the city had access to from the Owens Valley, Los Angeles bought up land from farmers in a way such that remaining acres would be left dryer. (Cooper 66) Those left in the valley fought back by attacking wells and the Aqueduct. It ended with Los Angeles buying out the whole valley leading to “hard feelings which time [have] not entirely healed to this day.” (Cooper 66) The social impact of the Aqueduct is much like a scar on the history of Owens Valley. Also, the agriculture that used to be in the valley dwindled to nothing in the face of the water demands of the steadily increasing city population. The Aqueduct prompted growth in industry and population of Los Angeles while destroying farms and causing social unrest throughout Owens Valley. The addition of this water source, which seemed long-lasting at the moment, would prove to be insufficient for growing needs in later years.

The Los Angeles Aqueduct was built as a connector between the Owen’s Valley Lake and has significantly impacted the surrounding ecology. Owen’s valley was once a scene filled with rich wildlife, but after the construction of the Aqueduct, many of the animals that inhabited the area began to vanish. Although the climate of Owen’s Valley was historically semiarid, the Aqueduct contributed to the dryness of the area and sucked out the remaining water from Owen’s Lake. The lack of water in Owen’s valley led to the overall destruction of its biodiversity. During the late 1950s all the way to the early 2000s, Owen’s Valley experienced a severe dry period. During this dry period, dust storms ravaged the valley frequently. This dust was created by the formation, and then removal by wind, of a crust which formed on the dry lake (Cahill 630). Dust storms created an ecological wasteland where no plants or animals would grow or flourish because the winds and dry soil did not allow for the survival of the plants. In addition, the animals were affected by the by the particles that were released by the storms.

Over the years, the Los Angeles Aqueduct has proven to be harmful for the ecology of the Owen’s Valley area but as of 2006 it has proven to be useful rather harmful. In the year 2006, Owen’s Lake has been filled with water once more as a result of a mandated order to restore and bring back water to the lake. Thanks to this decree, the river has become a “ribbon of life”, as Graham Chisholm states. Even though the only two native fish that roamed the river have disappeared, other fish such as trout and cattail have sought shelter in this same river. Another positive outcome, since water was reintroduced to Owen’s Lake, is that this body of water has become a magnet for a variety of birds. An estimated twenty-two different species have migrated to Owen’s Valley in 2006 on what is known as “the big day.” (Chisholm 85).

With such a high demand of water, it was foreseen that Owen’s Lake would soon be depleted and, sadly, this became a reality. In 1970, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power approved the development of a second Aqueduct to bring in more water from Owen’s Lake to Los Angeles (LA Aqueduct). Long after Owen’s Lake became a dry, flat, dirt bed and Los Angeles replenished it in 2006, conservation efforts have been successful. This was the direct result of efforts from the late 1970s when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power developed one of the most complete and well-rounded on-going water conservation programs. By promoting lower water usage of Los Angeles residents and implementing conservation methods, the need for the Los Angeles Aqueduct was slightly eased and consequently the need for water from Owen’s Lake. Access to public information about Los Angeles’ water reinforced conservation ethics among the residents. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also provides conservation devices and has source replacement programs to replenish water sources that they have depleted; Owen’s Lake was a direct receiver of these programs. These comprehensive water conservation efforts will keep the Los Angeles Aqueduct from becoming an empty channel that only serves as a reminder of the depletion of Owen’s Lake (Owens River).

Today the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power serves over four million residents and four-hundred-sixty-four square miles. It is no wonder that Los Angeles’ annual water demand is approximately one-hundred-ninety-seven billion gallons. Although the Los Angeles Aqueduct has been the center of controversy for years, its centennial was just celebrated in 2013.  The Los Angeles Aqueduct, though built in the early 1900s, still plays a key role in the complex systems and networks that bring water to the city of Los Angeles.
