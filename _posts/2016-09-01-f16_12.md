The Rodney King verdict of 1992 coincided with a history of racial issues, police brutality, the immediate consequence of which was the Los Angeles Riots. As shown in the article,“Business as Unusual,” from the UCLA Archive, various businesses and households were destroyed, and thousands of Angelenos found their livelihood decimated. A photography studio owner in south-central LA, having run the studio for just 4 months, found his studio burnt to the ground during The Riots; he had been earning $400 per week and had planned to insure his business soon. The loss of his studio forced him to give up his future jobs– losing out on a chunk of earnings. Many others found their stores pillaged by looters. The first act of looting set in motion a series of financial troubles for various owners as they struggled with mortgage, bills, and expenses after losing out on their source of income– their businesses. As years passed, investors injected millions into the rebuilding of various neighborhoods; however, many business owners had already lost their investment.

It all started after the words “not guilty” were repeatedly announced in a courthouse in Simi Valley. Just a few hours later, chaos emerged throughout the streets of Los Angeles, specifically South LA, in discontent at the verdict. The article “The L.A. Riots: 24 Years Later” mentions many protesters gathering at the Florence and Normandie intersection to physically hurt the bystanders by throwing beer cans at them (The Los Angeles Times Staff). Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, was pulled from his truck, brutally beaten, and nearly killed by protesters for no apparent reason. Many innocent people, like Denny, were physically hurt even though they had nothing to do with the verdict. It was a very devastating time because the rioters didn’t care who they hurt, as long as they brought attention to the issue. The Special Collections article, “Business as Unusual” (1992), examines a few of the many businesses and families affected by the riots.

Goldsmith, the writer, first reports the story of India’s Oven – a bakery located on Pico Boulevard. The bakery, along with the other businesses on the block, was burned down during the Riots. The owner was unsure if his insurance would mitigate the losses, and did not plan on reopening his business unless he found someone to loan him money. Goldsmith then describes the determination of a photo studio owner to stay in business and mend the damages caused by this uproar. The studio owner said “we’ll sell out of this parking lot if we have to.” Unlike India’s Oven, Samy’s Camera had support from employees, suppliers, and competing businesses to re-establish the business after the Riots. These were just a few stories of destruction in Los Angeles. Many more stories lie in the Southern part of this beautiful city.

The article “LA Riots Then &amp; Now” mentions that about 1,100 businesses were destroyed and roughly 3,000 fires were set (McDonald). In the course of  rage and frustration at the Rodney King verdict, especially in the context of racial discrimination and police brutality, people aimed to demand change and justice. While doing so, they caused great devastation in the community. Many people used this tense time as an opportunity for personal gains. The book Understanding the Riots by the Los Angeles Times Staff reports that women were caught looting liquor stores as a guy poured gasoline around the place (Los Angeles Times Staff, 57). The thieves didn’t think about the economic effects that would occur, but wanted to benefit themselves from the Riots. They merely used the Riots as an excuse to steal and obtain things for their personal benefit.

In the neighborhood of Pico and La Brea, there was severe devastation caused by the riots. In the article, “Starting From Scratch -- Small Business: Two Months After the Riots, the Reality of the Rebuilding Challenge Is Demonstrated on the Corner of Pico and La Brea” (July 5, 1992), Susan Moffat narrates the difficulty numerous businesses owners experienced to recover after the Los Angeles Riots. Moffat describes the long-lasting effects the Riots had on the business owners’ professional and personal lives. The article, published in Los Angeles Times, focuses on Joseph Kung’s struggle to rebuild his business in the face of the materialistic losses, economic hardships, and “bureaucratic maze.” Moffat points out that “around town, 37 of the 54 customers for Johnson's commercial cleaning service were burned out” and despite his effort to rebuild his business, he found himself trapped in the middle of the a long bureaucratic process. He went from one office to the other without obtaining solutions to his problem. Kung struggled to reconstruct his patrimony and the Riots effects were still evident “two months after the looting and burning where many still lie in ruins.” Kung exemplifies “series of personal financial disasters set in motion by well-organized looters” in 1992; “as a result of the riots, his revenue... dropped from $26,000 to $7,000 a month... years of labor and saving by this one man... gone up in smoke.” Kung’s business was not the only one affected by the LA Riots, but others such as the 99-cent Chinese Food, Fatburger, Rentronics, Any Kind Check Cashing (lost four out of its twenty-four stores in Los Angeles). The LA Riots affected Los Angeles businesses and the destruction was evident in Pico-La Brea intersection, Mid-city of Los Angeles.

Shortly after the Riots started, Bernard Kinsey and Peter Ueberroth formed “Rebuild LA,” an organization aiming to not only to rebuild businesses, but also better the community. The organization focused on South Central Los Angeles in particular. “Rebuild LA” had connections with the Los Angeles department of building and safety planning; therefore, with an endorsement from “Rebuild LA,” businesses could obtain building permits in as little as a year, compared to the standard three year waiting period. According to Kinsey, within the first two years of the organization’s formation, sixty-three percent of the damaged businesses in South Central Los Angeles were renovated. In order to better South Central, Kinsley and his organization focused on building more grocery stores, libraries, and drug stores- things the area lacked. In order to receive support from “Rebuild LA”, businesses had to follow two conditions- hire people who lived in a three mile radius of the store and have a Black, Latino, or Asian manager. Within the first six months, the organization helped build thirty businesses in South Central (Green, 2012). By 1994, Kinsley and Ueberroth left the organization because of political issues, which lead to the downfall of “Rebuild LA.” Even with the organization’s disintegration, business owners were determined to rebuild their source of income-their stores.

The 1992 Los Angeles Riots left the air of Los Angeles filled with despair and sadness as many Angelenos witnessed their beautiful city being destroyed by agitated mobs. The Riots devastated the city’s economic and personal stability.  Several shattered dreams lay on the street like shattered glass. A castle built stone by stone over the years was burned to the ground as if  it was made of paper. As civilians found no other method to demonstrate their disagreement, thousands of businesses were destroyed overnight. Many children lost their heroes and many saw their dreams burn away in the city of Angels.
