Meals for Millions, a foundation started by Clifford Edmond Clinton, received great news in August 1951. The company learned that Pearl S. Buck’s recently published novel God’s Men was based on Clinton’s work ethic and values. The book grasped the public’s attention, informing them of the mission of the foundation.

The news of the publication was reported through a company newsletter. This document, which provides a list of the Advisory Committee and Board members, gives brief insight into the goal of Meals for Millions. The newsletter enhances understanding of Los Angeles by shedding light on a positive foundation meant for helping working class both locally and globally.

Meals for Millions, the predecessor of present-day Freedom from Hunger, opened a new prospect in hunger relief efforts by developing a food supplement derived from soybean products. This nonprofit organization was founded by Clifford Edmond Clinton (August 3, 1900 – November 20, 1969), a California restaurateur who owned Clifton’s Cafeteria  that still exists today in downtown Los Angeles. Clinton spent his childhood in China with missionary works and this experience shaped his life to practice Christianity by helping hungry people. When he opened Clifton’s Cafeteria in 1931, he never refused to serve a person who could not afford a meal. During the Great Depression, the restaurant was recognized for its written policy: “no guest need go hungry for lack for funds” (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 7). Clinton decided to expand his charity work in downtown Los Angeles and spread it around the world.

In 1944, Clinton asked Dr. Henry Borsook, a professor of biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, to develop a food product with complete nutrition that costs no more than three cents a meal. Clinton offered a $5,000 research grant and Dr. Borsook invented Multi-Purpose Food in less than a year (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 8). Multi-Purpose Food made by soybeans had great potential to banish starvation from the earth; however, neither government agencies nor relief organizations came forward to distribute the food supplement. As a result, Clinton, along with Dr. Borsook and a few California business associates, established their own nonprofit organization, Meals for Millions Foundation in 1946 (mealsformillions.com).

Meals for Millions worked for relief and prevention of starvation in many countries after World War II. During the next ten years after its establishment, Meals for Millions distributed 6.5 millions of Multi-Purpose Food to relief agencies in 129 countries (mealsformillions.com). The achievement gradually gained recognition by media. In 1951, Pearl Buck, the Nobel Literature Prize laureate who admired Clinton, wrote a novel titled God’s Men, in which the main character is a reflection of Clinton (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 8).

In the 1960’s, while Meals for Millions continued to engage actively in relief works, Clinton retired as president and the organization experienced great transition—a switch from a distributor of relief food to a facilitator of food processing that aims to help people help themselves (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 9). Operating this self-help program, Meals for Millions merged with the American Freedom from Hunger foundation in 1979. The two groups became Meals for Millions/ Freedom from Hunger Foundation, which was later shortened to “Freedom from Hunger Foundation” (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 10). Today, Freedom from Hunger is still working to fight against chronic starvation and poverty, as a pioneer of nutrition and health education.
